My design focuses on at-a-glance usability for the user with all the information on the periphery. This makes it the most efficient at executing it's primary job of showing a reflection while also providing any information that the user may need.

* Clock
    * Being placed in the top left will provide a natural place where the eye will be drawn to. Since this is most likely the most used feature time will be displayed here.
* Schedule
    * As people may forget exactly what is on their agenda placing it directly below the clock will help remind the user.
* Sleep
    * The information this low is nice to know but most likely not critical to the users daily habits. It will show the amount of deep sleep, light sleep, and time awake from the night before.
* Weight
    * As something that is unlikely to fluctuate this information is also of low priority. Can be displayed in pounds or kilograms.
* Exercise
    * Displays the amount of time a user has spent exercising during the day.
* Media feed
    * The media feed will scroll between personalized news titles, social media feeds, and unread text messages whenever applicable. Being at the top and center gives the most display area to give full strings of text as well as be in an eye-catching location for the user.
* Mirror time
    * The location for mirror time mirrors the clock for design consistency.
* Weather
    * The weather can be used to inform the user how they should prepare for the day. It will display the current days high, low, and forecasted type of weather such as sunny, rainy, etc.
